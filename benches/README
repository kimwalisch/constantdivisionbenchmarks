Run simplified_primes_benches.sh to compile and run
a prime-finding benchmark that was originally written
in C++ for use with libdivide.

OFK rewrote it in C, to simplify and allow easier checks
of the assembly code (eg verify that the compiler has not
vectorized one option.) Does not have internal timing code;
run with perf tools instead.

Code was cloned for each of the various divisibility-check
approaches, to keep each individual program short.

Added a Granlund/Montgomery divisibility option to be a
more fair competition to the Lemire approach. This application
guarantees we are checking only odd divisors, a best-case
scenario for Granlund&Montgomery.
