We benchmark a na√Øve linear congruential generator, see
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_congruential_generator

We generate the ith value, starting from the seed.

Usually, for obvious reasons, the modulus is set to a power of two,
or to a value close to a power of two. But we want to stress
the modulo operation.
